OATH IN GENERIC APPLICATION
1.user login to the client application 
2.client-server will make request to client-auth-server for authentication 
3.client-auth-server will authentication user 
4.user will get access to the client application 
5.user proceed will action which required resource on the resource-server 
6.client-server will make request to the resource-server for access the resource 
7.resource-server will notified the resource owner which is user 
saying that client-server want to access resource from resource-server and show the login 
window for the user for loggin in to the resource-server 
8.user will enter the credentials for the resource-server in login screen
9.resource-server will send the credentials to the resource-auth-server for authentication
10. then  resource-auth-server will authentication the user 
11. then resource-server will show the information about the resource which
 client-server want to access from the resource-server 
12.then user will allow the access to the resource holding by the resource-server 
13.then resource-server will request the resource-auth-server to generate a token which is authentication token 
13.1 then authentication token  will send to client-server 
13.2 then authentication token  is verified by client-server and respond back to the resource-server
13.3 then resource-serve with the help of the resource-auth-server will create a access token 
with the access privilege to acces the resource on the resource-server.
14.then resource-auth-server will generate a token with appropriate access permissions 
15.this token will be given back to the client-server for further communications with resource-server 
16.then client-server will make a request to the resource-server with token provided by resource-server 
17.then resource-server will intercept the token and then send to the resource-auth-server for authentication 
18.once the token is verified then resource-server will grant access to the client-server request 
to access the resource hold by resource-server 
19.resource-server will get the requested resource 
20 resource-server will return the requested resource resource will return to the client-server



OAUTH IN MICROSERVICES 
0.User is already authenticated 
1.User will make request to the api server for information related 
  to the personal academic and contact 
2.then api server internally make call to the micro-service-0 which has personal 
information but required academic and contact information from other micro-services
3.then micro-service-0 will make request to the authentication-server with the client-id 
4.then server will return the token with the access privilege to access the micro-service-1
5.then micro-service-0 will make a call to the micro-service-1 for
  accessing the academic information which is part of the token and 
  it will clearly specify that it has ready or write privilege 
6. micro-service-1 will verify the token and its access privilege and request resource 
and decide that request is valid resource or not if its valid then return the resource. 
NOTE:if micro-service-0 will make a request to access the professional information and 
access privilege in token is not mentioned then micro-service-1 will deny the request to serve 
7.then the information of personale with academic is return to api-server
8.api-server will again make request to the micro-service-0 for personal information with contact 
9. micro-service-0 has personal information but it has to access the 
 contact information form micro-service-2 so it will make the 
 request to the authentication-server with the client-id 
10. authentication-server will check the client-id and then it wil return the token and 
 provide the access privilege in the token 
11. micro-service-0 will user the token and make a request to the micro-service-1
12. micro-service-2 will validate the token and also the access privilege and request for 
  resource and decide that weather the client which is micro-service-0 is elegible to 
  access the requested resource form micro-service-2 or not if the token has suffice 
  privilege then micro-service-2 will provide the resource as response to the micro-service-0
NOTE:if micro-service-0 will make a request to access the address information and 
access privilege in token is not mentioned then micro-service-2 will deny the request to serve   
13.then micro-service-0 will return the information of the personal and contact to the 
  api-server 
14.then api-server will return the data to the client   


JWT WORK IN AUTHENTICATIN 
1.user make a request to the resource-server for accessing the resource 
2.server will deny the request and instruct for login 
3.user will make a request to the server with valid credentials and pass the client-id in header 
4.resource-server will forward the request to the auth-server for authentication and authorization 
5.once the credentials are authenticated then the jwt token will be created which contains 
 user information and expiration data and other custom information and token will be signed 
 with the client-id secret which is already in the auth-server and return to the resource-server
 
 JWT-TOKEN: is a value token becoz it contains actual information values in it. 
 where as session token are referenced token wehre session is stored in server and 
 session id is referenced by the token in cookies 
 it has three part header,payload,signature
 
 xxx-header-xxx.xxx-payload-xxx.xxx-signature-xxx
 header contains(what is the type of token and algo to verify the signature)and encoded in base64 
 payload contains (id,name,issued time) and encoded in base64 
 signature contains(algo information which is used for signing the 
 json using the secret key which only server has)its also and encoded in base64 
 
6.then resource-server will take token and return back to the user 
7.user will make the request to the resource-server with the token and client-id 
8.resource-server will take token and forward that to the auth-server for 
 validated the token for expiry and signature.
9.auth-server  uses the client-id secret which is  already with the auth-server to
 get the user information form the token and validate the user information 
 and get the access privilege for the user based on the user informaton 
 and return back to the resource-server 
10.now resource-server has the access privilege which it will set to the security context 
of the application and check the original resource request by the user and fetch the resource
for the user 
11. resource-server will get the requested resource then create a http response 
12. resource-server will return the http response to the user and clear the security context
